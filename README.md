# Web Design Using Javascript 

## Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Level 1 of the assignment is under the folder: **UFO-level-1**. This contains the `index.html` file, a basic HTML web page that was created to display the dynamic table of UFO sightings.  A copf of this HTML file is also placed in the root of the Github repo for a github page.

* Using the UFO dataset that was provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, code was written in `app.js` that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Each UFO sighting will have data for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.



## Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Level 2 of the assignment is under the folder: **UFO-level-2**. This contains the `index.html` file, created to display the dynamic table of UFO sightings with an advanced filter option.

* Using multiple select dropdowns, JavaScript code was written in `app-advanced.js` so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
